# Invasive Species Detection and Monitoring

Invasive species pose a global threat to ecosystem health and economic stability. Accurate information on the distribution and abundance of invasive species is crucial for meeting global biodiversity conservation goals and reducing the costs of invasion. Traditional methods of collecting data can be both labor-intensive and prohibitively expensive, limiting their utility in addressing the global proliferation of invasive species. Thus, the escalating scale and impacts of invasive species necessitate the development of alternative approaches for efficient detection and dynamic monitoring.

# Problem Statement

The purpose of this project is to address the challenges associated with invasive species management and prediction by developing innovative techniques. Species Distribution Models (SDMs) are the backbone of invasive species management and prediction but are not without flaws and bias. Remote sensing offers a promising alternative to traditional on-the-ground data collection for detecting and monitoring plant species and communities, as it overcomes logistical constraints and provides large-scale, cost-effective data. However, species-level detection can be challenging due to factors such as population density, growth form, and phenology.

# Solution

This project aims to compare species distribution models and remote sensing applications for species mapping to assess and monitor invasive species' distributions. Remote sensing techniques aim to predict actual species distribution with a higher resolution, whereas SDMs primarily focus on broad-scale climatic suitability models for potential species distribution. The complementary nature of SDMs and remote sensing offers unique insights and applications for invasive species detection and management.
